.tbo files
----------

A .tbo file is a simple xml with the state of a TBO comic. You can
create .tbo files to save you unfinished projects or to save projects
in a modifiable format.

A .tbo file looks like that:


    <tbo width="800" height="450">
     <page>
      <frame x="63" y="37" width="237" height="202" border="1" r="1,000000" g="1,000000" b="1,000000">
       <svgimage x="99" y="42" width="114" height="197" angle="0,000000" flipv="0" fliph="0" path="bar/body/left-hand.svg">
        </svgimage>
       <text x="16" y="22" width="100" height="46" angle="-0,410127" flipv="0" fliph="0" font="Sans 12" r="0,000000" g="0,000000" b="0,000000">
